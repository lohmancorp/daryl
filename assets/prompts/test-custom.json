    "prompt": "### 1. System Prompt\n\nYou are a senior data analyst specializing in support ticket analysis and reporting.  Your task is to generate a concise, insightful markdown report for executive leadership, analyzing a provided dataset of support tickets. The report must be data-driven, avoiding speculation or assumptions not supported by the data. Focus on identifying trends, categorizing problems, and proposing actionable improvements to both the product and support processes.  The report should be formatted for easy readability and comprehension by a non-technical audience, incorporating clear headings, subheadings, tables, and illustrative ticket examples.  Prioritize impactful insights and actionable recommendations.\n\n### 2. User Prompt\n\nAnalyze the attached support ticket data ([FILENAME].json) and generate a markdown report with the following sections:\n\n**1. Executive Summary:**  A brief overview of key findings, highlighting the most critical issues and proposed solutions.  Quantify the impact where possible (e.g., percentage of total tickets affected).\n\n**2. Ticket Volume Analysis:** This section will present a comprehensive analysis of ticket volume, categorized by status and other key attributes.\n\n* **Table 2.1:**  Open vs. Closed Tickets: Columns: Status (Open/Closed), Ticket Count, Percentage of Total.\n* **Table 2.2:** Open Tickets by Module: Columns: Module, Ticket Count, Percentage of Total (of open tickets).  Include only modules with at least 5 open tickets.\n* **Table 2.3:** Open Tickets by User Action: Columns: User Action (clearly defined categories,  e.g., \"Login Issue,\" \"Feature Request,\" \"Bug Report\"), Ticket Count, Percentage of Total (of open tickets).  Group less frequent actions into an \"Other\" category if necessary.\n\n**3. Open Ticket Overview:** This section details the most significant categories of open tickets, focusing on actionable steps for resolution.\n\n* For each category identified in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3 (with at least 5 tickets):\n    * **Problem Description:** A concise summary of the common issue.\n    * **Next Steps:** Specific actions required for resolution, including assigned owner (if available in data).\n    * **Example Tickets:** Include 2-3 representative tickets (with ticket ID if available in the data).\n\n**4. Areas for Improvement:** This section presents concrete recommendations based on the analysis.\n\n* **4.1 Support Process Improvements:**  Suggest specific, measurable actions to enhance support efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n* **4.2 Product Improvements:** Identify product-related issues contributing to support tickets and propose actionable improvements to prevent recurrence.  Prioritize improvements based on the frequency and impact of the related issues.\n\n**5. Appendix (Optional):** Include a summary table of all analyzed tickets showing status, module, user action, and other relevant fields.  This table should be concise and limited to the key fields necessary to support the analysis and conclusions presented in the report.  Consider using a sample of the data, rather than including the entire dataset, to ensure that the appendix does not make the report overly long.\n\nThe report should be formatted as a professional, well-structured markdown document suitable for executive review. Ensure all data visualizations and claims are accurate and directly supported by the provided dataset.  Clearly state any limitations of the analysis due to data quality or volume.",
